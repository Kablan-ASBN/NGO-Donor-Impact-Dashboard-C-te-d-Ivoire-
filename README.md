# NGO Donor & Impact Dashboard (Côte d’Ivoire)

## Project Overview
This project shows a donor and impact reporting dashboard I created for my NGO in Côte d’Ivoire, **Fondation DMConfection (2018–2024)**.  

We had a problem:  
- Four regional teams (Abidjan, Bouaké, San Pedro, Yamoussoukro) sent data in different formats.  
- Consolidation was slow, errors were common, and donor updates were delayed.  

My solution:  
- Standardized the reports with **Excel templates** (locked fields for consistency).  
- Used **VBA macros** to auto-calc totals and reduce manual errors.  
- Connected the data into **Power BI/Tableau** for real-time dashboards.  

This improved donor retention by **~20%** and raised on-time reporting to **95%**.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Retention Curve** → donor retention rate over time, benchmarked at 75%.  
- **Donor Origins** → funding sources (Côte d’Ivoire, France, UNESCO, etc.).  
- **Regional Impact** → number of students supported by each region.  
- **Impact Scatterplot** → link between funds raised and students supported.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** → templates + macros for automation  
- **Power BI/Tableau** → dashboard and reporting  
- **CSV** → structured dataset for reproducibility

## Impact
- Donor retention grew from **60% → 80%** (2018–2024).  
- Over **700 students** supported.  
- New donors onboarded (UNESCO in 2023).  
- Gave stakeholders **clear visibility** and faster updates.
